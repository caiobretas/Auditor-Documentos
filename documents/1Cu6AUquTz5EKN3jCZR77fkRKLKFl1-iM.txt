Rodrigo de Brito, nº 14, apartamento 401, Botafogo, na Cidade e Estado de Rio de Janeiro, CEP: 
22.280-100 (“Comodatária”), declaro, na presente data, que realizei a devolução do Equipamento 
listado abaixo de propriedade da LUMX STUDIOS S.A., sociedade anônima de capital fechado, 
inscrita no CNPJ/MF sob o nº 42.887.120/0001-00, com sede à Rua Voluntários da Pátria, nº 89, sala 
804, Botafogo, na Cidade e Estado de Rio de Janeiro, CEP: 22.270-000 (“Comodante”), que recebi 
em razão do Contrato de Comodato celebrado em 26 de maio de 2022 (“Contrato de Comodato”):

hipótese, a Comodante poderá solicitar a reparação dos mesmos e encaminhar os custos do prejuízo 
incorrido para que a Comodatária realize o devido reembolso.

ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE  
From time to time, LUMX STUDIOS S.A. (we, us or Company) may be required by law to 
provide to you certain written notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and 
conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through the DocuSign 
system. Please read the information below carefully and thoroughly, and if you can access this 
information electronically to your satisfaction and agree to this Electronic Record and Signature 
Disclosure (ERSD), please confirm your agreement by selecting the check-box next to ‘I agree to 
use electronic records and signatures’ before clicking ‘CONTINUE’ within the DocuSign 
system. 
 
Getting paper copies  
At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available 
electronically to you by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send 
to you through the DocuSign system during and immediately after the signing session and, if you 
elect to create a DocuSign account, you may access the documents for a limited period of time 
(usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to 
send you paper copies of any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a 
$0.00 per-page fee. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the 
procedure described below. 
 
Withdrawing your consent  
If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time 
change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures 
only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future notices and 
disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures 
electronically is described below. 
 
Consequences of changing your mind  
If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the 
speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to 
you because we will need first to send the required notices or disclosures to you in paper format, 
and then wait until we receive back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such 
paper notices or disclosures. Further, you will no longer be able to use the DocuSign system to 
receive required notices and consents electronically from us or to sign electronically documents 
from us. 
 
All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically

Partes concordam em: Caio Barbosa Zacarias, Jeane Resque Gomes dos Santos
Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide 
electronically to you through the DocuSign system all required notices, disclosures, 
authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to be provided or made 
available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of you 
inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required 
notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given 
us. Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through 
the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as 
described below. Please also see the paragraph immediately above that describes the 
consequences of your electing not to receive delivery of the notices and disclosures 
electronically from us. 
 
How to contact LUMX STUDIOS S.A.:  
You may contact us to let us know of your changes as to how we may contact you electronically, 
to request paper copies of certain information from us, and to withdraw your prior consent to 
receive notices and disclosures electronically as follows:

the body of such request you must state: your previous email address, your new email 
address.  We do not require any other information from you to change your email address.  
If you created a DocuSign account, you may update it with your new email address through your 
account preferences.  
 
To request paper copies from LUMX STUDIOS S.A.  
To request delivery from us of paper copies of the notices and disclosures previously provided 
by us to you electronically, you must send us an email to admin@lumxstudios.com and in the 
body of such request you must state your email address, full name, mailing address, and 
telephone number. We will bill you for any fees at that time, if any. 
 
To withdraw your consent with LUMX STUDIOS S.A.  
To inform us that you no longer wish to receive future notices and disclosures in electronic 
format you may: 
i. decline to sign a document from within your signing session, and on the subsequent page, 
select the check-box indicating you wish to withdraw your consent, or you may; 
ii. send us an email to admin@lumxstudios.com and in the body of such request you must state 
your email, full name, mailing address, and telephone number. We do not need any other 
information from you to withdraw consent..  The consequences of your withdrawing consent for 
online documents will be that transactions may take a longer time to process.. 
 
Required hardware and software  
The minimum system requirements for using the DocuSign system may change over time. The 
current system requirements are found here: https://support.docusign.com/guides/signer-guide-
signing-system-requirements.  
 
Acknowledging your access and consent to receive and sign documents electronically

other electronic notices and disclosures that we will provide to you, please confirm that you have 
read this ERSD, and (i) that you are able to print on paper or electronically save this ERSD for 
your future reference and access; or (ii) that you are able to email this ERSD to an email address 
where you will be able to print on paper or save it for your future reference and access. Further, 
if you consent to receiving notices and disclosures exclusively in electronic format as described 
herein, then select the check-box next to ‘I agree to use electronic records and signatures’ before 
clicking ‘CONTINUE’ within the DocuSign system.

available to you by LUMX STUDIOS S.A. during the course of your relationship with 
LUMX STUDIOS S.A..
